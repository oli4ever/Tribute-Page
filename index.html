            <h3 id="info-title">Timeline of Dr. Muhammad Yunus's Life</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> <b>1940</b> - Dr. Muhammad Yunus born in Chittagong, Bangladesh, is a social entrepreneur,
                    economist, and the
                    founder of Grameen Bank.</li>
                <li><b>1944</b> - His family moved to the city of Chittagong and he moved from his village school to
                    Lamabazar Primary School.</li>
                <li><b>1955</b> - He passed the matriculation examination from <b>Chittagong Collegiate School</b> ranking 16th
                    of 39,000 students in East Pakistan. During his school years, he was an active Boy Scout and
                    travelled to West Pakistan, India and Canada to attend Jamborees.</li>
                <li><b>1961</b> - Completed his MA from the <b>Department of Economics</b> at Dhaka University.</li>
                <li><b>1965</b> - He received a <b>Fulbright scholarship</b> to study in the United States.</li>
                <li><b>1969</b> - He received his <b>PhD</b> in economics from the <b>Vanderbilt University</b> Graduate Program in
                    Economic Development (GPED) in 1969 and the following year became an assistant professor of economics at <b>Middle Tennessee State University </b> in Murfreesboro.</li>
                    <li><b>1971</b> - During the Bangladesh <b>Liberation War</b> in 1971, Yunus founded a citizen's
                    committee and ran the <b>Bangladesh Information Center</b>, with other Bangladeshis in the United States,
                    to raise support for liberation. He also published the <b>Bangladesh Newsletter</b> from his home in
                    Nashville. After the War, he returned to Bangladesh and was appointed to the government's Planning
                    Commission headed by Nurul Islam.
                    However, he found the job boring and resigned to join Chittagong University as head of the Economics
                    department.</li>
                <li><b>1974</b> - After observing the famine of 1974, he became involved in poverty reduction and
                    established a rural economic programme as a research project. He also published the Book <b>Three Farmers of Jobra</b> from Department of Economics, Chittagong University.</li>
                <li><b>1976</b> - During visits to the poorest households in the village of Jobra near Chittagong
                    University, Yunus discovered that very small loans could make a disproportionate difference to a
                    poor person. Village women who made bamboo furniture had to take usurious loans to buy bamboo, and
                    repay
                    their profits to the lenders. Traditional banks did not want to make tiny loans at reasonable
                    interest to the poor due to high risk of default. But Yunus believed that, given the chance, the
                    poor
                    will not need to pay high interest on the money, can keep any profits from their own labour, and
                    hence
                    microcredit was a viable business model. Yunus lent US$27 of his money to 42 women in the
                    village, who made a profit of BDT 0.50 (US$0.02) each on the loan.Thus, Yunus is credited
                    with the idea of <b>Microcredit</b>. In December 1976, Yunus finally secured a loan from the government
                    Janata Bank to lend to the poor
                    in Jobra. The institution continued to operate, securing loans from other banks for its projects.
                </li>
                <li><b>1978</b> - Received the <b>President's Award</b> in Bangladesh.</li>
                <li><b>1983</b> - On 1st October 1983, the pilot project began operation as a full-fledged bank for poor
                    Bangladeshis and was renamed <b>Grameen Bank</b> ("Village Bank").
                    To ensure repayment, the bank uses a system of "solidarity groups". These small informal groups
                    apply together for loans and its members act as co-guarantors of repayment and support one another's
                    efforts at economic self-advancement.</li>
                <li><b>1984</b> - Received the <b>Ramon Magsaysay Award</b> in Philippines.</li>
                <li><b>1989</b> - The fisheries project became <b>Grameen Motsho</b> ("Grameen Fisheries Foundation") and the
                    irrigation project became <b>Grameen Krishi</b> ("Grameen Agriculture Foundation"). In time, the Grameen
                    initiative grew into a multi-faceted group of profitable and non-profit ventures, including major
                    projects like <b>Grameen Trust</b> and <b>Grameen Fund</b>, which runs equity projects like <b>Grameen Software
                    Limited</b>, <b>Grameen CyberNet Limited</b>, and <b>Grameen Knitwear Limited</b>, as well as <b>Grameen Telecom</b>, which
                    has a stake in <b>Grameenphone (GP)</b>, the biggest private phone company in Bangladesh.
                    The success of the Grameen microfinance model inspired similar efforts in about 100 developing
                    countries and even in developed countries including the United States. Many microcredit projects
                    retain Grameen's emphasis of lending to women. More than 94% of Grameen loans have gone to women,
                    who suffer disproportionately from poverty and who are more likely than men to devote their earnings
                    to their families.</li>
                <li><b>1993-1995</b> - Professor Yunus was a member of the <b>International Advisory Group</b> for the Fourth

                    Academy Member in 2001. According to Rashidul Bari, the Grameen's social business model has gone

                    social business and corporations.</li>

            <q><em>Muhammad Yunus has shown himself to be a leader who has managed to translate visions into practical action for the benefit of millions of people, not only in Bangladesh, but also in many other countries. Loans to poor people without any financial security had appeared to be an impossible idea. From modest beginnings three decades ago, Yunus has, first and foremost through Grameen Bank, developed micro-credit into an ever more important instrument in the struggle against poverty.</em></q>
